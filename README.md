# cuisine_explorer

Thanks, for viewing my project.

This project is a simple web application that allows users to explore and search for dishes based on various criteria. It provides a list of dishes with details such as name, preparation and cooking times, diet type, course type, state, and region. Users can also search for dishes by ingredient.

You can run the project by running the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
in both cuisine-explorer-app and server directories.

### Scope of Improvement -

1. Dynamic Ingredient Search
